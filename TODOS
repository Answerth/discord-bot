-refactor main bot code, outsourcing command logic to its respective cog


-ge price getter
-- /slash command for price check that looks up item id in database, checks https://api.weirdgloop.org/exchange/history/rs/all?id=4151 for historical, and provides relevant information 
-- WoW, MoM, YoY both price and volume
- store relevant_items price weekly to allow for desired_item alerts / checking / market analytics

---potentially scrape all item categories for easier categorization analytics 

-WFE html file maker
-- build matrix of wfe special events y hour and by day
-- create html table with special formatting around special events, add column for desired timezone and UTC
-- discord slash command to select timezone and produce file for download


Drop alerter: 
-Update all clan activities 
--Create a >> last run.time file? 
--Rerun classified query on latest activities table
-- One time: add posted column Mark all exempt if older than 48 hrs or not important drop / achievement
--- monitoring digest to see if intervention needed (ie failed inserts, unclassified activities): output to file
-- shelved: check against current price / factor in player total level / drop value
-repeat logic: 
-- Get query for latest activity by member
--get member activities for members active within 14 days / hourly
--get member activities all members / daily
---Classify + exempt
---Digest: all unclassified activities for review
---Select non-exempt items, Alert, mark alerted in database, wait within rate limits, alert next, repeat


-/rsn signup module
-associates discord user id with rns(s)
-used for drop alerting, event alerting, etc
-works with discord nick change detector / rsn name change detector

drop alerter changes: 
-refer instead of all to /rsn signup table
-if activity name matches with anyone in the rsn.rsn field, tag @associated_discord_user
--- discord id / nickname storage | discord members table -> /rsn stores discord id , rsn's 
--- rsn name updater updartes clan members rsn and any matching rsns in /rsn table(?)
SCRAPPED:  alternatively, if clan members get a unique id, rsn updater updates userid name, /rsn stores discord id, and if any rsns match members name, store unique id, doesnt work for non-clan memebers, too much maintenence to automate


-rsn updatedr / activitiy hasher

- discord id + name/nickname store and check for updated name/nick
----
/rsn table
/members table
/discordusers table
